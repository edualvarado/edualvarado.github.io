Welcome to my homepage! 

###### Important update!

This is the HTML/CSS/JS source code for my first homepage version hosted in [edualvarado.github.io](https://edualvarado.github.io/), but it is an old version. Therefore, it will **not** be updated with new content! 

I decided to migrate my new version homepage to WordPress/PHP. 

**Check it out!** :)

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)

you can use for pretty much whatever.
